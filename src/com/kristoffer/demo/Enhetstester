Why Unit testing?

    * Find eventual problems before publishing code
    * New functionality, same tests
    * Saves Time, Effort and energy
    * Writing Tests is efficient

    How to work:
        * Annotations marks Unit Tests with JUnit (@Test)
        * Built in functions to assertIfTrue()
        * @Test() annotation (method level)
            * Annotation is a 'synthetic Meta Data'

    When to use:
        * First write logic (objects, methods, variables)
        * Instead of clicking 'play' / 'run', do a TEST
        * When running a test, check for MULTIPLE CONDITIONS:
            * Datatype
            * IF Null
            * True
            * SOUT excluded from MAIN
            * Sequence of methods, right order?

    Debugging VS Unit Testing?
        *** Debugging ***
            --> Run the app
            --> Breakpoints
            --> Terminal and flow

        *** Unit Testing ***
            --> Do not NEED to run ENTIRE app
            --> Limit tests to certain methods
            --> New functionality, quicker to debug

        Conclusion: "With unit Tests, lets say you have 100 lines of new code
                    Do we have to RUN the entire app to see the new functionality?

                    Answer is: No. It is unnecessary! "
